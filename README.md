# RockPaperScissor-CNN

This is a project using Keras and it imports the Rock Paper Scissor library from Tensorflow datasets. It runs the model on basic MLP, a simple CNN, additional CNN layers and even with HyperParameters Tuning and at each step we get a better accuracy.
<br/> <br/> Finally we save the model, load it again and reevaulate using the test data.
